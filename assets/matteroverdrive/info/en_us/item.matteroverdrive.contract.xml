        <text class="matter-text text-block">Contracts contain Quests. They can be previewed by the player before accepting them.
            Contracts can be obtained in many ways. They can be generated using the [item name=contract_market], by finding them in the world or by talking to NPCs.</text>
        <text class="matter-text text-block">Once a quest is accepted the player can view and track it using the [item name=data_pad]. They offer different item rewards as well as XP.
            Once a quest is completed by the player it cannot be accepted again.</text>
