        <text class="matter-text text-block">The range of the $itemName allows it for kills over great distances. It is also the weapon that benefits most by weapon scopes, especially the [item name=sniper_scope].</text>
        <text class="matter-text text-block">Ranged rogue androids can wield this weapon as well, and will be quite deadly and will target enemies from great distances.</text>
        <text class="matter-text text-block">Like most energy weapons the $itemName can be rapidly recharged by [item name=energy_pack],
            overhead if fired continually without stopping and can be upgraded using weapon modules at the [block name=weapon_station].</text>

        <text class="matter-text text-block">The $itemName can also be dropped by Ranged Rogue Androids. There are also Legendary versions of the sniper dropped only by Legendary Rogue Androids.
            The Legendary versions can have increased base stats that can stack with weapon modules.
            Stats such as higher meta fire rate and greater accuracy.</text>
