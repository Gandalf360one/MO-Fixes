            It can shoot plasma bolts at enemies but it's range is smaller than it's rifle counterpart the [item name=phaser_rifle]. Although the meta is a lot smaller than the [item name=phaser_rifle] the $itemName can also mine blocks by holding the right mouse button.</text>

            overhead if fired continually without stopping and can be upgraded using weapon modules at the [block name=weapon_station].</text>
        <text class="matter-text text-block">The $itemName allows for all types of weapon modules except weapon sights.</text>

        <text class="matter-text text-block">The $itemName can also be dropped by Rogue Androids. There are also Legendary versions of the tool dropped only by Legendary Rogue Androids. The Legendary versions can have increased base stats that can stack with weapon modules. Stats such as higher meta fire rate and greater accuracy.</text>
