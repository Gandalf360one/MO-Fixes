        <text class="matter-text text-block">This pipe is used to transfer matter from one to another machine.</text>
        <text class="matter-text text-block">There is also a better variant which can transport more than the normal variant at once.</text>
        <text class="matter-text text-block"></text>
        <text class="matter-text text-block">These Pipes have no recipe beacause they can cause crashes and heavy lags.</text>
        <text class="matter-text text-block">Please use fluid pipes from another mod f.e. Thermal Dynamics, EnderIO, Mekanism,... to connect your machines and fill them with matter.</text>
