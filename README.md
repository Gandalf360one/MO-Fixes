A Texturepack to improve Matter-Overdrive: Legacy Edition

For more informations about what got changed/fixed look at this side:
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/matter-overdrive-fixes

Why I made this open source?
- Yes I know that a resourcepack can easily be modified and that stuff but the reason is that maybe some things are not right translated/spelled or descriped inside the Data-Pad or some textures/models look awefull.
So feel free to create a pull request :)
